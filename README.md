# esx_poolcleaner

This is a modified version of this script https://github.com/Cha0sNighT/esx_poolcleaner


# Getting Started

Just drag and drop the folder into the workspace.
Add the sql to your database.
And you should be set.

# Configuration

All of the configuration is in the config.lua

# Reminder
This isn't a very optimized script or I even wouldn't say the best coded one. I did this as a fun project on my server. If you have anything to add please make a pull request or create a issue.
